BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fixed a bug in baseflow function that caused issues when date and 
	discharge data were in columns other than columns 1 and 2.

* added to Colwells function the ability to output a dataframe of the 
	indices only.

*	shifted the reporting of record length from high.spells to baseflows
	function so that if outputs are combined in a dataframe, record
	length is now the first variable if baseflows is the first function run.

* various corrections/edits to the manual pages.
